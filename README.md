# Spotify-Wrapped
My Spotify on a Dashboard

With music being a part of my daily life, the annual release of Spotify Wrapped has always been a moment of excitement and reflection. However, as exciting as it is, the experience is short-lived, available only for a limited time. Faced with this realization, I embarked on a journey to leverage my data analytical skills to craft an interactive and personalized Spotify Wrapped experience.

Drawing inspiration from Spotify's innovative approach to data visualization, I sought to replicate and extend the experience, ensuring that insights into my music consumption would remain accessible and engaging year-round. Thus, the idea of crafting my very own personalized Spotify Wrapped Dashboard was born—a project that would not only provide a comprehensive snapshot of my musical preferences but also serve as a testament to the power of data analytics in illuminating personal experiences.

In this report, I invite you to join me on this journey as we explore the process of creating and refining my personalized Spotify Wrapped. We’re going to take a closer look at my music preferences. We'll explore which artists and songs I love the most, and we'll dig into any interesting patterns we find. Think of it as an adventure where we use data to better understand how music influences my life. So, let's embark on this journey together and uncover the fascinating connection between music and data!
